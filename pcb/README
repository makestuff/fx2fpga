The PCB is a small interface card with an FX2LP micro and a connector which allows
it to be plugged into a Digilent S3BOARD FPGA starter kit. In addition to the FPGA
interface there is a HiSpeed USB connector and an SD-card slot.

This board was made with Eagle5 (http://www.cadsoft.de) and etched at home using
tools from http://www.megauk.com. It is dual-layer, and has large octagonal vias
to make drilling easier.

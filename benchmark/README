Read 1Mbyte of data from random.dat and send it to EP6 of the FX2. You will need
the usbutil package to build this.

The random.dat file can contain anything. You can make one with dd thus:

dd if=/dev/urandom of=random.dat bs=1024 count=1024

The FPGA keeps a 16-bit checksum of the data sent; it should match the checksum
output from this program:

$ sudo ./benchmark 
21.592676 MB/s
checksum=0xBE86

Why only 21.6Mbyte/s? Others have seen closer 40Mbyte/s with similar setups, so
I'm not entirely sure. I suspect it may be bottlenecked by my USB host controller.

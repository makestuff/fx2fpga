The FPGA design is intended for the Digilent S3BOARD. The FX2 board plugs into
port A2. The FPGA asserts SLOE and SLRD, and deasserts SLWR and PKTEND. It also
drives "10" on the FIFOADR[0..1] lines to select EP6. The FX2 drives the IFCLK
at 48MHz and dumps incoming USB packets onto the FD[0..7] lines, driving FLAGC
("gotData" in the VHDL) high during the rising edge of IFCLK to clock a byte
into the FPGA, which maintains a 16-bit checksum which it displays on the S3BOARD's
seven-segment displays. The bit pattern of the last byte clocked in is displayed
on the LEDs.

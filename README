The FX2FPGA board is a small PCB which plugs into the A2 port of a Digilent
S3BOARD. It offers a Hi-Speed USB port and an SD-card slot, and uses the
Cypress FX2LP chip to manage USB transfers.

    pcb - the design of the printed circuit board
    vhdl - the FPGA design; you'll need Xilinx ISE WebPack to use this
    benchmark - benchmark host code using libusb

The benchmark code just measures the time taken to dump 1Mbyte of data from a
file to EP6 of the FX2LP and prints a checksum and a throughput in Mbyte/s. The
checksum displayed by the FPGA board and the checksum output by the benchmark
should match.

The benchmark program assumes the FX2 chip is running the firmware from the
fx2tools package which you can get from here:
